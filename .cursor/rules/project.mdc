# 🎯 Project Overview

This is a **3D image stamping demo** application built with React and Three.js.

## Core Functionality

### Image Upload & Placement
- User uploads an image via UI control
- User clicks on a mesh to place a stamp at the clicked point's UV coordinates
- The image is drawn to a texture at the placement location

### Interactive Widget System
- When a stamp is placed, a **widget** is displayed at the point of contact
- The widget has **two axes (X and Y)** aligned with the image orientation in 3D space
- Each axis end has **invisible colliders** that are larger than the visual elements for easier hit testing

### Interaction Modes

#### Resize Mode
- User clicks on a widget axis collider and drags to resize along that axis
- The stamp/image is resized proportionally along the selected axis

#### Orbit Mode
- User clicks and drags anywhere else (not on widget colliders)
- Orbit controls are activated and camera position is manipulated
- This allows the user to navigate the 3D scene

## Technical Stack
- **React** - UI framework
- **Three.js** - 3D rendering and scene management
- **TypeScript** - Type safety
- **Zustand** (likely) - State management (based on store directory)

## Key Components
- `ThreeScene.tsx` - Main 3D scene component
- `InteractionManager.ts` - Handles interaction modes and tool switching
- `editorStore.ts` - Application state management
- `widget.ts` - Widget rendering and hit testing logic
- Tools: `DragTool`, `OrbitTool`, `ResizeTool`, `SelectionTool`
